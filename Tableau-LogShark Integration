•	Please note that Logshark generates Tableau workbooks and to view them, you will need to have access to a machine with Tableau Desktop version 10.5 (or later) or Tableau Online.

Tableau Log Requirements:

Publish Logshark Results to Tableau Server

If you want to publish the workbooks to Tableau Server instead of the default \Output folder, you need to modify the <LogShark_install_location>\Config\LogSharkConfig.json file and use the -p or --publishworkbooks option when you run LogShark. Here is the syntax to use.

LogShark <LogSetLocation> Options -p
You will need to update the <LogShark_install_location>\Config\LogSharkConfig.json file. Change the <TableauServer> settings to match your Tableau Server configuration.

"TableauServer": {
    "Url": "<EnterServerUrlHere>",
    "Site": "<EnterSiteNameHere>",
    "Username": "<EnterUsernameHere>",
    "Password": "<EnterPasswordHere>",
    "Timeout": 240,
